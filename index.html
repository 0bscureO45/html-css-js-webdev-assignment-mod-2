                The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
                for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
                assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting
                languages such as JavaScript.

                Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing
                the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
                HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is 
                one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
                and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client
                side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
